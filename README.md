**Category:** ARTILLERY_MANUFACTURING · **Ecosystem:** python · **Vendored upstream:** https://github.com/o-murphy/js-ballistics · **Pinned commit:** `b71066fd5b80f1ee9b790a6b35a89bfd28a16315` · **Vendor:** Anticloud FZ LLE

## What This Project Is

JavaScript/TypeScript library for small arms ballistic trajectory calculations, powered by a C++ engine compiled to a standalone WebAssembly module.

This is the upstream project, vendored at the pinned commit above and packaged offline-first. The 12 improvements Anticloud adds live in `anticloud/` and are described under *Anticloud Overlay* below. Every fact in this file traces to a file in this directory.

## Installation

```bash
make build          # bare WASM + TypeScript (full build)
make build-wasm     # WASM only  → generates build/bclibc.js (base64-embedded module)
make build-ts       # TypeScript only  → generates dist/
```

## Usage

```typescript
import {
    Calculator,
    Shot,
    Weapon,
    Ammo,
    DragModel,
    DragTables,
    Atmo,
    Wind,
    UNew,
    Distance,
    Velocity,
    Angular,
} from "js-ballistics";

const dm = new DragModel({
    bc: 0.223,
    dragTable: DragTables.G7,
    weight: 168,
    diameter: 0.308,
});
const ammo = new Ammo({ dm, mv: UNew.FPS(2750) });
const weapon = new Weapon({ sightHeight: UNew.Inch(2) });
const shot = new Shot({ weapon, ammo });

const calc = new Calculator();

## Anticloud Overlay

The 12 improvements live under `anticloud/`. Run the check suite from this directory:
